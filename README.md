All code Created for the University of Galway GEEC DAQ by Conor Farrell and Breand√°n Gillanders.

The code is divided into 3 sections:
  1. Completed Scripts: These are scripts which have been made to test specific functionality and to start integrating other functions
  2. DAQ Scripts, these are scripts which have all functionality and are designed to work on the DAQ PCB with all parts
  3. Data Analysis Scripts, these are scripts which take in the SD card data from the DAQ and can create graphs/PDFs

There is also the code for the steering wheel display.
The code used at the SEM 2024 exists in the file SEM Scripts.
